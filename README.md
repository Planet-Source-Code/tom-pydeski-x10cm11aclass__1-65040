### Description

X10 put out some nifty home control products that communicate

over the power lines and respond to commands to turn on; turn off; dim; etc.

The CM11A is device that interfaces a pc to the command line protocol and also

contains timers and macros.

This project is a class I wrote to emulate what the keware ocx does.

Keware (http://www.homeseer.com/downloads/index.htm)

It can control devices in any housecode from your pc. It also monitors devices that are turned on or off from a remote or firecracker interface and raises events when this happens.

The HouseCode can be any 1 of 16 (A through P) and each house code can handle

any of 16 devices (1 to 16).

I started out with the firecracker class I wrote

http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=64719&amp;lngWId=1

and I experimented with it and took information from the x10 protocol file

I made some switches and used a vertical progress bar to set the dim level.

I implemented a device status for each device. Finally, I was able to implement

the all on and all off commands.

Of course all of this is useless if you don't have the x10 hardware that it
 
### More Info
 
You must have the x10 CM11a pc interface and some x10 modules.
